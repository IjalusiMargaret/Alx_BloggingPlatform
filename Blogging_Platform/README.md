Blogging Platform API
Overview
Welcome to the Blogging Platform API! This is a dynamic content management system designed for both bloggers and readers. The platform allows users to manage blog posts, interact with content, and enjoy features like commenting, liking, sharing posts, and subscribing to other bloggers or categories.

Built using Django REST Framework, this platform provides a user-friendly and scalable solution for managing blog content. Whether you're a blogger looking to share posts or a reader exploring content, this platform offers a great experience.

Send a POST request to /api/token/ with your username and password to get the token.
